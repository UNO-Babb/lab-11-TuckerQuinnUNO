I adjusted a few things, I made the amount of items vary from 0 to 50, but also made it so that if it was below 25, it would go up by 5, and if it was above 25, it would go down by 5. 
This gives a closer to bell shape distribution then normal randomization.
I made the shoppers random from 1 to 5 minutes, and made the time to shop each item vary from 1 to 1/3 of a minute.
I think the ideal number of checkers for this set of assumptions is 2, as increasing the number of checkers to 3 or more has a small impact on wait time, but a large impact on idle time. 
Decreasing the number of checkers to 1 drastically increases the average wait time, so I think 2 is the best middle-ground.
